## Document 1: Shoplite User Registration Process

To create a Shoplite account, users begin by navigating to the registration page and entering their email address, password, and basic profile details such as full name and shipping address. Passwords must meet security requirements: at least eight characters long, with one number, and one special character. Once the form is submitted, Shoplite automatically sends a verification email that must be completed within 24 hours. Until verification is complete, accounts remain restricted from placing orders, following sellers, or saving items. This ensures that all accounts are tied to valid, unique email addresses.

Shoplite offers two account types: buyer accounts and seller accounts. Buyer accounts are free and grant access to browsing, ordering, reviewing products, and maintaining wishlists. Seller accounts, on the other hand, require additional business verification. Applicants must provide valid business registration documents, proof of identity, tax information, and bank account details. Seller applications are reviewed within two to three business days, during which Shoplite ensures compliance with regulations and fraud prevention policies.

Duplicate email registrations are not allowed. If an attempt is made to register with an email that already exists in the system, the user is prompted to reset their password instead of creating a new account. Customer support agents are trained to assist with registration issues, resend verification emails, and resolve duplicate account conflicts.

Shoplite also monitors for suspicious activity, such as multiple account registrations from the same IP or device. In such cases, additional verification may be required. Once registration is verified, users can log in, manage their accounts, and begin using all of Shoplite’s features.

## Document 2: Shoplite Shopping Cart Features

The Shoplite shopping cart is designed to make the shopping experience smooth and flexible for buyers. Users can add products to the cart from any product page and continue browsing without interruption. The cart supports mixed-seller orders, meaning items from different merchants can be purchased together. Shipping fees for each seller are calculated individually to maintain accuracy. Logged-in users benefit from persistent cart storage across sessions, ensuring that their items remain saved even after logging out or switching devices. For users not yet ready to buy, items can be marked as “Save for Later.”

During checkout, the cart provides a real-time calculation of taxes and shipping fees. Customers can apply one promotional code per order, with the system automatically validating the code before applying it. Invalid or expired codes are rejected with clear feedback to the user. Estimated delivery times for each item are shown based on availability and courier options. The cart also automatically flags items that are running low in stock, encouraging customers to complete purchases before items sell out.

To ensure fairness, stock levels are verified again during checkout. If an item sells out while a user is completing payment, the system will immediately notify them and remove the unavailable item. Abandoned cart reminders are optionally sent by email to encourage users to finish transactions. Changes made on the mobile app are instantly synced to the web cart, providing a unified multi-device experience. These features collectively enhance user convenience while preventing overselling and ensuring transparent pricing.

## Document 3: Shoplite Payment Methods and Security

Shoplite supports multiple payment methods to accommodate user preferences. Customers can pay using Visa, Mastercard, and major debit cards. In certain regions, Cash on Delivery (COD) is also available. COD allows users to pay at the time of delivery, but refunds for COD orders are always issued via bank transfer. Refunds typically take 7–10 business days depending on bank processing times. Shoplite does not yet support digital wallets such as Apple Pay or PayPal, though these may be added in future updates.

All online transactions are encrypted and processed through PCI-compliant payment gateways. Shoplite does not store full card details on its servers, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected. Payment receipts are emailed immediately after a transaction is confirmed, and customers can download invoices from their order history page. For additional security, Shoplite provides fraud detection that monitors unusual payment patterns such as repeated failed attempts or mismatched billing addresses. Orders flagged as suspicious may be temporarily placed on hold until verified by customer support.

Users can manage their payment preferences from the account dashboard, including updating billing addresses and removing outdated payment methods. If a payment fails, customers receive guidance on retrying or switching to an alternative method. By combining multiple payment options, strict compliance with security standards, and robust fraud detection, Shoplite ensures a safe, reliable checkout experience for all customers.

## Document 4: Shoplite Order Tracking and Delivery

After placing an order on Shoplite, customers can track their purchase step by step. Orders pass through several distinct stages: Placed, Packed, Shipped, Out for Delivery, and Delivered. Each stage automatically triggers email and push notifications so that customers are always informed of their order’s status. Within the “My Orders” section of the website and mobile app, customers can view real-time updates, expected delivery dates, and courier details. Tracking numbers are generated once an order is shipped, and users can follow their package directly through integrated courier systems.

Delivery times depend on the service chosen. Standard delivery typically takes 3–5 business days, while express delivery, available for an extra fee, promises 1–2 business days. During checkout, estimated delivery windows are calculated using stock availability, warehouse location, and courier capacity. Shoplite ensures that if an order is delayed more than seven days beyond its estimated delivery, the customer can request a refund for shipping charges.

If a delivery attempt fails, couriers make up to two additional attempts before returning the package to the seller. In such cases, Shoplite processes a refund once the item is returned and inspected. For high-value orders, a delivery confirmation signature or app-based acknowledgment may be required to confirm receipt. Currently, Shoplite offers domestic deliveries only and does not yet support international shipping. This structured approach provides transparency, reliability, and flexibility for customers expecting timely deliveries.

## Document 5: Shoplite Return and Refund Policies

Shoplite provides clear guidelines for returns and refunds to maintain trust between customers and sellers. Eligible items may be returned within 14 days of delivery, provided they are unused, unopened, and in their original packaging. To initiate a return, customers log into their Shoplite account, navigate to “My Orders,” and select the “Request Return” option. Once the request is approved, a courier pickup is scheduled within three business days. Customers are notified of pickup times, and they can monitor the return’s progress online.

Refunds are processed within 7–10 business days after the returned item is received and verified. Refunds always go back to the original payment method. In the case of Cash on Delivery purchases, refunds are transferred to the customer’s bank account. Customers are required to provide bank details when initiating COD refunds. Shoplite ensures that communication is transparent by providing email confirmations and real-time status updates during each step of the refund process.

Some products are excluded from return eligibility. These include consumable goods such as food or supplements, hygiene-related items, and any product marked as “Final Sale.” If an order arrives with missing items or damage caused during shipping, partial refunds may be offered. In cases where the seller is at fault, they bear the cost of return shipping; otherwise, the customer may have return shipping deducted from their refund. By balancing customer rights with seller protections, Shoplite creates a fair and consistent return policy.

## Document 6: Shoplite Product Reviews and Ratings

Shoplite’s review and rating system empowers customers to share feedback and guide future buyers. Verified purchasers—customers who have completed a successful transaction—are eligible to leave reviews. Reviews include a 1–5 star rating, optional written feedback, and photo uploads for visual context. Reviews are displayed publicly on product pages and strongly influence seller reputations and search rankings. Products with consistently high ratings receive “Top Rated” badges, giving them increased visibility in search results.

To ensure reliability, Shoplite moderates reviews using automated filters and human review. Inappropriate language, spam, or unrelated content is flagged and removed. Sellers are not allowed to edit or delete customer reviews but may post public replies to address concerns. This open dialogue helps improve trust between sellers and buyers while encouraging accountability.

Customers browsing reviews can filter results by star rating, recency, or keyword search. This allows buyers to find the most relevant opinions quickly. In some cases, Shoplite may incentivize reviews by awarding loyalty points, though reviews must always remain honest and unbiased. To prevent fraudulent activity, reviews are tied directly to completed transactions, and multiple reviews from the same order are not permitted. The system is designed to balance transparency, fairness, and accuracy, ensuring that buyers make informed decisions while sellers receive constructive feedback.

## Document 7: Shoplite Seller Account Setup and Management

Shoplite provides a streamlined process for businesses and individuals who want to sell on the platform. To apply for a seller account, applicants must submit required business documents, such as proof of registration, tax identification, and valid banking details. Sellers may also be asked to submit product samples or inventory lists for verification. Applications are typically reviewed within 2–3 business days, and once approved, sellers gain access to the Seller Dashboard.

The Seller Dashboard is the central hub for managing an online store. Sellers can upload product listings, set prices, monitor sales, and manage customer inquiries. Shoplite provides reporting tools that highlight key metrics like sales growth, best-selling items, and customer satisfaction trends. Sellers can also schedule promotions and apply discounts to drive sales. Payouts are issued weekly, provided the account balance exceeds the minimum threshold of $100.

Shoplite enforces policies to maintain quality and customer trust. Sellers must adhere to delivery timeframes, provide authentic products, and respond promptly to customer inquiries. Repeated violations, such as selling counterfeit goods or failing to meet delivery standards, may result in penalties or account suspension. Shoplite also offers seller support services, including tutorials, live assistance, and dispute resolution. By combining efficient onboarding, robust tools, and strict compliance, Shoplite ensures a fair and sustainable marketplace for its sellers.

## Document 8: Shoplite Inventory Management for Sellers

Managing inventory accurately is crucial for sellers on Shoplite. Sellers are required to update stock counts in real time, either through the Seller Dashboard or via API integration. If stock for an item falls to zero, the platform automatically marks it as “Sold Out” to prevent overselling. To help sellers manage supply effectively, Shoplite offers low-stock alerts, typically triggered when inventory falls below 10% of its initial quantity. These alerts appear on the Seller Dashboard and can also be sent by email or mobile app notifications.

Shoplite enforces stock validation at checkout. Before confirming an order, the system double-checks available quantities to ensure items are still in stock. If inventory has sold out during the checkout process, the customer is notified immediately, and the order cannot proceed. Sellers may optionally enable backordering for high-demand products, allowing customers to place orders that will be fulfilled once stock is replenished within a defined timeframe.

Detailed reporting tools provide insights into stock turnover, slow-moving products, and restock needs. Sellers are encouraged to integrate warehouse management systems to reduce errors and improve efficiency. If sellers consistently fail to maintain accurate inventory, Shoplite may impose penalties such as temporary suspension of listings. By combining real-time validation, proactive alerts, and detailed analytics, Shoplite ensures that inventory management supports a reliable customer experience and minimizes lost sales opportunities.

## Document 9: Shoplite Commission and Fee Structure

Shoplite operates on a transparent commission-based fee model for sellers. For each completed order, a standard commission of 10% is deducted from the seller’s payout. This percentage may vary slightly by category, with premium or high-risk products sometimes incurring different rates. In addition to commission, sellers pay transaction fees charged by payment providers, usually 2–3% per order. These charges are clearly itemized in monthly invoices accessible via the Seller Dashboard.

Optional services, such as featured product placement or sponsored advertising, carry additional costs. Sellers can review the terms of these services before opting in. Shoplite provides tools for monitoring promotional performance, ensuring sellers understand the return on investment for advertising spend. Payouts are issued weekly once the seller’s account balance reaches or exceeds $100. Balances below this threshold roll over to the following week.

Chargebacks and disputes are handled transparently. If a chargeback is issued, the disputed amount is deducted from the seller’s next payout. Shoplite also provides dispute resolution assistance to minimize financial impact. The combination of predictable commission rates, clear transaction fees, and optional paid services allows sellers to manage costs effectively while maintaining profitability on the platform.

## Document 10: Shoplite Customer Support Procedures

Shoplite offers customer support through multiple channels, including live chat, email, and phone support. Standard support hours are Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time. Customers can typically expect responses within 24–48 hours for tickets submitted by email. For urgent issues such as failed payments or delivery problems, live chat is recommended, as it provides near real-time assistance.

The support team is trained to address common issues like account login problems, order tracking, refunds, payment disputes, and seller onboarding. Agents can also resend verification emails and assist with duplicate account conflicts. Shoplite uses a ticketing system to route cases to specialized teams, ensuring that technical problems, payment issues, or seller inquiries are handled by the right experts.

Escalated cases, such as fraud investigations or repeated delivery failures, are managed by senior staff for thorough resolution. After each case is closed, customers receive a feedback survey to rate their experience. Negative trends trigger internal reviews to improve response quality. Shoplite emphasizes quick and fair resolution of issues to maintain trust and satisfaction for both buyers and sellers.

## Document 11: Shoplite Mobile App Features

The Shoplite mobile app provides a seamless shopping experience on iOS and Android devices. Customers can browse products, use advanced filters, add items to their cart, and complete checkout with a touch-friendly interface. The app syncs data across platforms, so cart updates or wishlists created on the website appear instantly on mobile. Push notifications alert customers about order confirmations, shipping updates, and promotional offers. Exclusive mobile-only discounts are also available, encouraging users to engage with the app regularly.

Security features include biometric login options such as fingerprint or face recognition. The app also supports barcode scanning, allowing customers to search for products by scanning packaging or receipts. For sellers, the mobile app includes tools to update inventory, view sales reports, and respond to customer inquiries directly. This makes it possible for sellers to manage their business on the go.

Regular updates improve app performance, introduce new features, and fix bugs. Shoplite invests heavily in maintaining the app to ensure reliability and speed. With millions of downloads and daily active users, the mobile app is one of Shoplite’s most important customer engagement tools.

## Document 12: Shoplite API Documentation for Developers

Shoplite offers a REST-based API to support developers and sellers who need to integrate external systems. The API enables inventory synchronization, automated order management, and retrieval of product and customer data. All endpoints return JSON-formatted responses and require OAuth 2.0 authentication for security. API keys are obtained by registering through the Shoplite Developer Portal.

The API includes endpoints for creating and updating products, retrieving order details, processing payments, and checking account balances. Rate limits apply: the default limit is 100 requests per minute per client. Developers are advised to implement retry logic with exponential backoff when rate limits are exceeded. Shoplite also provides sandbox environments for safe testing before deploying integrations in production.

Error handling is standardized. Common error codes include 401 for invalid authentication, 429 for exceeding rate limits, and 400 for malformed requests. Each error response includes a clear message to guide debugging. Documentation includes examples of request and response payloads, as well as best practices for authentication and performance optimization. A dedicated developer forum and ticketing system provide additional technical support for registered developers.

## Document 13: Shoplite Security and Privacy Policies

Shoplite prioritizes account security and compliance with global data protection standards. Sensitive data such as passwords is stored using salted hashing algorithms. All traffic is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher, and customer information is encrypted at rest. Users can enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to add another layer of account protection. If suspicious activity is detected, such as repeated failed login attempts or multiple new accounts from the same IP, Shoplite may temporarily lock accounts.

Privacy practices align with GDPR and similar regulations. Users can request secure data exports or account deletion at any time. When accounts are deleted, personal data is anonymized, although order history may remain for compliance. Audit logs record all significant account actions and can be reviewed internally for investigations. Shoplite does not sell or share user data with third parties. Access to sensitive information is restricted to authorized staff only.

Fraud detection algorithms continuously monitor for unusual payment activity or abnormal order volumes. Accounts flagged for potential fraud may be suspended while investigations are completed. Shoplite undergoes regular third-party security audits to validate practices and maintain compliance. By combining strong encryption, strict privacy policies, and proactive fraud detection, Shoplite ensures both buyers and sellers can use the platform confidently.

## Document 14: Shoplite Promotional Codes and Discounts

Promotional codes on Shoplite offer customers a way to save during checkout. Only one code may be applied per order, and codes cannot be stacked. Discounts are applied before taxes and shipping fees. Codes must be valid and unexpired; otherwise, the system rejects them automatically. Region-specific codes are validated based on the delivery address provided during checkout.

Certain exclusions apply. Promotional codes may not be used on restricted categories such as electronics, gift cards, or items marked “Final Sale.” Codes must be entered during checkout and cannot be applied retroactively to completed purchases. Shoplite occasionally offers targeted discounts for first-time buyers or app-exclusive campaigns, encouraging customer acquisition and loyalty.

Sellers can create their own discount campaigns through the Seller Dashboard. These promotions are subject to approval and must follow Shoplite’s pricing policies. Analytics tools allow sellers to track redemption rates and performance. By balancing platform-wide codes with seller-managed promotions, Shoplite provides flexible discounting while maintaining pricing integrity across the marketplace.

## Document 15: Shoplite Warranty and Claims

Some products on Shoplite include manufacturer warranties, which are clearly displayed on product pages. Warranty terms vary by brand but typically cover defects for six to twelve months. To initiate a claim, customers must contact Shoplite support with proof of purchase and photos or documentation of the defect. Support staff coordinate with the manufacturer or seller to validate the claim and determine eligibility.

If the claim is approved, customers may receive a replacement product or full refund. If a replacement is unavailable, a refund is processed to the original payment method. In some cases, Shoplite may provide store credit as an alternative if agreed upon by the customer. Claims for damage caused by misuse, accidents, or unauthorized repairs are not covered under warranty.

Customers can monitor claim status through the “My Orders” section, similar to return requests. Updates are sent via email to keep users informed. Shoplite itself does not extend warranties beyond those provided by manufacturers, but it enforces seller responsibility to honor valid claims. By managing the claim process and ensuring timely resolution, Shoplite helps customers feel secure in purchasing products that include warranty coverage.
