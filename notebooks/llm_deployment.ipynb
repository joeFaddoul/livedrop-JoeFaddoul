Customers can pay using Visa, Mastercard, and major debit cards. In certain regions, Cash on Delivery (COD) is also available. COD allows users to pay at the time of delivery, but refunds for COD orders are always issued via bank transfer, taking 7–10 business days depending on bank processing times. Digital wallets such as Apple Pay or PayPal are not currently supported but may be added in future updates. All online transactions are encrypted and processed through PCI-compliant payment gateways, ensuring secure transactions. Payment receipts are emailed immediately after a transaction is confirmed, and customers can download invoices from their order history page.\n",
